# Installation

Most projects start with a template. Let's use a basic template maintained by React Bridging:

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-react-bridging@latest my-react-bridging-app
```

Now change into the new directory and start the app

```shellscript nonumber
cd my-react-bridging-app
npm i
npm run dev
```

You can now open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

You can [view the template on GitHub][default-template] to see how to manually set up your project.

To get started with a template that deploys to your preferred host, check out [all of our templates](https://github.com/khulnasoft/react-bridging-templates).
